        <h4>
            Girls & women join forces to make a difference! Participants collaborate to
            develop and realize a solution to one of our Impact Projects.
            Impact Projects can be nominated by anyone via our website and are reviewed by
            Girls Can Code committee and Impact Lab participants for implementation.
            Once a project is identified, we involve all our girls in building a realization strategy
            and work together to develop a solution.

    <h4>
        <p>Salento Apuglia Project - in this Impact Lab series, we will be building a platform to
            support the local olive farmers, whose livelihoods have been devastated by the
            Xilella Fastidiosa bacteria. There is no treatment for the bacteria and entire olive
            plantations must be replanted. Since the timeline for olive trees to become productive
            is approximately 10 years - the economic devastation for the local farmers is enormous,
            wiping out their main source of income.
        </p>
        <p>Our Impact Project will focus on working with local farmers in the Puglia region to develop and
            implement a ‘Responsible Holidays’ platform. The platform will allow tourists to identify and
            book responsible holidays – where tourists can help the local farmers to rebuild their farms,
            while lodging at the rustic Italian farms and experiencing the charm of
            southern Italy first hand.

    <h2 class="font-pink-goals w3-xxlarge">About Salento</h2>
    <h4>
        <p>Salento is the name of a 100 km long and 40 km wide beautiful peninsula in the extreme
            southeast of Italy,
            which  is often referred to as situated in the “heel” of the Italian “boot”.
        </p>
        <p>The region relies heavily on two sources of income:
            <br>Tourism - Clear blue Meditarreneant water and stunning coast, often referred as the
            Maldives of Italy,
            the rich baroque architecture in contrast to the rural “trulli” white houses that recall Greece,
            and the good genuine food based on vegetable and fresh fish.
        </p>
        <p>Olive Oil Production - The geographic situation and climate support an extensive production of
            olive oil
            from ancestral olive trees spread all over the territory.

            Xylella Fastidiosa
    </h3>
        </p>
    <h4>
        <p>'The first withered olive trees appeared near Gallipoli, in the Apulia region of southern Italy.
            Bunches of leaves turned brown and crunchy around the edges. Then, whole groves started to wane.
            Farmers whose families had tended olives for generations watched their trees dry up and their
            businesses
            plummet.
        </p>
        <p>At first, it wasn’t clear what was causing the decline. Was it a fungus? A virus? Something else
            entirely?
            Scientists showed up in the olive groves to sample the trees, urgently trying to find the cause.
        </p>
        <p>One researcher from a local agricultural institute had just come back from a conference in
            California,
            where he’d learned about the plant bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. The symptoms the olive
            growers were
            seeing, he realized, looked exactly like what seen in the talks he'd attended.
            Sure enough, when he and
            his colleagues tested the Italian trees, they found the bacterium lurking in their
            woody hearts.
        </p>
        <p>This was not good news. The European Commission considers Xylella to be among the most
            dangerous plant
            bacteria in the world. Different strains of it have wreaked havoc on vineyards in California
            and citrus
            trees in Brazil, killing acres of valuable plants and causing billions in lost revenue.
        </p>
        <p>Until the olive trees fell ill, Xylella had never been seen in Europe, and its identification
            in Italy
            set off alarm bells across the scientific and political communities of the European Union.
            Italian olive growers
            produce 15 percent of the world’s virgin olive oil, worth more than $2 billion each year.
            Spain produces even more. Anything that threatened the trees threatened the entire
            European economy.
        </p>
        <p>Olives are also central to the identity of the region. Over 60 million trees stand in
            stately rows across
            Puglia, which—until recently—produced about 40 percent of all the olive oil Italy exports.
            Nearly half a million trees are the beloved “ulivi secolari,” centuries-old trees whose
            gnarled trunks
            have stood firm even as vast changes swept across the region.
        </p>
        <p>On the farms, the news was bleak - the farmers watched helplessly as their trees weakened.
            By 2018, they’d lost more than 65 percent of their trees. It is estimated that by 2020 the
            region will have
            lost nearly 90 percent. On average it takes between 10 and 20 years to grow a productive
            olive tree.
            Scientists estimate that it will take 50 years to restore the groves.’  Unfortunately,
            there is no
            effective treatment - which means that tens of millions of trees must be uprooted,
            burnt and replanted.
        </p>
        <p>A sliver of hope comes from the agricultural institutions, who have started testing
            hundreds of cultivars
            of olives to find ones that might be resistant to the bacteria. So far, they’ve
            found at least two very
            promising possible options.

        <p>Ongoing Local Support - Organize local initiatives for girls of all ages to get familiar with
            technologies to support and manage the booking platform, as well as build e-shop to sell
            local products online.
